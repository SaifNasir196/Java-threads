/*
 * 
 * Thread Class vs Runnable Interface 
 *
 *	- If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
 *
 * 	- We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
 *
 *	- Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.
